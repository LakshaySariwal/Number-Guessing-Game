🎮 Number Guessing Game

A simple and fun Python-based console game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess it.

The game provides helpful hints after each incorrect attempt:

📉 If your guess is too high, it asks you to guess a lower number.

📈 If your guess is too low, it asks you to guess a higher number.

🎉 When you guess correctly, it displays the total number of attempts taken.
